# My-CNC-Remastered-mods

Author: Daniel Romero Mujalli -- Kerekupai-meru (steam)

Here you can find and download the mods I have created for command and conquer remastered. 

If you would like to use the material for own projects, please give the corresponding credits.
Be fair. Do not steal the work of others.
Many thanks in advance!

I have uploaded only those files from the source code that I have modified to create the mods.
You will need to download the source code independently.

List of mods:
- immersive_helis
- Ra immersive helis
- TD color mod
- RA color mod
- TD Mujalli Mod
- RA Mujalli Mod (not finished yet!)

If you would like to use material from any of my mods that are not released yet, let me know 
and I can prepare it for you.

In case, you are interested in the back-to-work feature for technicians, I strongly
recommend to implement it the way it is done for RA Mujalli Mod (not TD Mujalli Mod!).
It is way simpler in the former case.

Please feel free to contact me if you have questions.
Have fun commander!
